### Hey there, I'm Shawn 👋

I'm Shawn Schwartz, a cognitive neuroscience PhD student at the [Stanford Memory Lab](https://memorylab.stanford.edu/) in Palo Alto, California. My primary research investigates the role of attention lapsing on memory failure and the neural mechanisms subserving episodic memory retrieval in young and older humans adults. I did my master's at UCLA in [computational evolutionary biology](https://michaelalfaro.github.io/alfaro-lab/) where I worked on [high-throughput](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13712) pipelines for facilitating large-scale analyses of phenotype, as well as collaborated on numerous published [human memory and education](https://castel.psych.ucla.edu) research.

Don't hesitate to reach out if there's something cool you'd like to collaborate on.
