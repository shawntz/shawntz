### hey there, i'm shawn 👋

i'm a phd candidate in cognitive neuroscience at the [stanford memory lab](https://memorylab.stanford.edu/). 

my research investigates the neural mechanisms underlying lapses in sustained attention, and how these lapses relate to episodic memory performance in young and older adults. 

i'm also one of the stats consultants in the [stanford department of psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu).

before stanford, i completed my master's and bachelor's degrees at ucla (go bruins!) in [computational biology](https://michaelalfaro.github.io/alfaro-lab/) where I worked on [high-throughput](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13712) phenoscaping pipelines as well as research in [human memory and education](https://castel.psych.ucla.edu).
